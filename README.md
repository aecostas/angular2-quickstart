# Angular2 Quickstart App

## NOTE!

This repo was based on the Angular 2 docs as it stood February 2016. Better and more accurate code examples and quick-starts most probably exist. **This repo is no longer maintained.**

This repo is the end result of the "[5 min quickstart](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html)" guide at [angular.io](https://angular.io)

> Let's start from zero and build a super simple Angular 2 application in TypeScript.

## Install

    git clone https://github.com/stigok/angular2-quickstart
    cd angular2-quickstart
    npm install
    npm start

## Working with TypeScript

I was new to TypeScript before looking on Angular2. The Atom plugin [atom-typescript](https://github.com/TypeStrong/atom-typescript) made transitioning easy with built-in linting, auto-complete and more.

    apm install atom-typescript
